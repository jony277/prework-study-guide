# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was build to help organize the different information that is going to be acquired 
in the bootcamp and also to help manage it in a more creative way. It helps with the problem of having to much 
information laying arround by concentraiting it in a single webpage. It helped me learn more about the different lenguajes and structures
that a simple webpage has and how to use it for better results.
